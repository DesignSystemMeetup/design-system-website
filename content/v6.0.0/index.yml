      A design system that nobody can understand is a design system nobody can use. This is why good documentation is so key to having a well-used and
      well-loved design system. I will walk you through two of Atlassian's documentation sites for the company-wide design system & component library
      Atlaskit, showing how the content is built and written, and the practical steps you can take immediately to tackle the hard problems around
      large documentation projects.

    title: What I’ve learned building automated documentation for Ansarada’s design system

      That’s right. We are building automated docs for our design system, but that’s not the best part. It will work with any React project. In this talk I’m
      gonna share with you what I’ve learned in the process and show you how we built it (for the techies)
