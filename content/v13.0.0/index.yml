    title: The "state" of UI
    description: |
      This will come as a surprise to many of you, but user interfaces on the web, have different types of state. It might be that "State", much like "Design
      Systems", is a word that has lost all meaning for you, but regardless, I think you will agree the UI state designers talk about is different
      from the application state developers refer to. Let's figure out how to have a discussion about these similar sounding but very different
      concepts for the sake of our sanity and better design system components.
