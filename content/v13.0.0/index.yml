  Design System meetup Sydney v13.0.0 streamed for the very first time online.
  Mehran Granfar spoke about building scalable framework-agnostic design systems with web components
  and Mike Riethmuller took us through the different states a component may have and what that means for design.

      Weâ€™ll look at some of the nitty gritty, understand the benefits of this approach, explore common pitfalls, viable governance models, and architectural
      setups to ensure adoption and scale.

    title: The "state" of UI
    description: |
      This will come as a surprise to many of you, but user interfaces on the web, have different types of state. It might be that "State", much like "Design
      Systems", is a word that has lost all meaning for you, but regardless, I think you will agree the UI state designers talk about is different
      from the application state developers refer to. Let's figure out how to have a discussion about these similar sounding but very different
      concepts for the sake of our sanity and better design system components.
