  Style guides, design guides, pattern libraries, design systems….oh my!
  If you are thinking about—or are currently creating/maintaining—a Design System, this meetup is for you.
  It provides an opportunity for those interested in the challenges of delivering Design Systems to exchange ideas and experiences.
