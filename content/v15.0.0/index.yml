      GraphQL for designers
    description: |
      Why do developers love GraphQL and how can designers best work with them?

      GraphQL is still the new kid on the block, but every day a new project is using it as "The API".
      In a world with increasingly complex requirements and engineering effort, finding the best way to understand and work with GraphQL can be beneficial
      for both designers and engineers.
      In this talk we'll cover:
      - What is GraphQL exactly
      - The benefits of GraphQL in a world of complex related data
      - Introducing the Gap Analysis System to level up the design <-> engineering collaboration
