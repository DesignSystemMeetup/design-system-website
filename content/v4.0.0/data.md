      Have you ever wondered why you “favourite” one thing but “star” something else?
      What role do Design System teams play when naming a brand new feature or renaming a legacy concept?
      Sarah Karp, a Content Design Manager at Atlassian, shares what goes on behind the scenes of a product terminology decision.
      In this talk, you’ll learn how to validate a terminology choice, get buy-in from stakeholders, and streamline naming decisions into a process that can be
      shared across entire organisations.
