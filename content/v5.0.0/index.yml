    A living design system that is consumed by other teams is an internal product, and maintaining it comes with challenges. This talk shares Ansarada's
    approach to maintaining a design system and why it needs product management to be successful.

    **Bio:**
    Charlotte is a Product Manager at Ansarada. In her previous role at Clearleft in the UK, she was a front end developer who built component libraries for
    clients, and helped teams build their own. Two things she loves about her job are writing documentation and facilitating collaboration.

    Come and hear what we've learnt at Atlassian since we started to treat our Design System as a product for products
    and take away 5 steps you can follow to apply product thinking right away.

    **Bio:**
    Tom has more than 14 years' experience building and leading software products and teams at eBay and Atlassian. Tom enjoys story-telling and coaching as
    much as building product visions and making sense of the world with frameworks and diagrams. He is currently Principal Product Manager for the Atlassian
    Design System and his favourite products are his two incredible daughters.

    Designing for immersive computing (AR, VR, and new ambient surfaces) requires a new way of thinking about design, new design systems, and a new type of
    design team made up of diverse backgrounds and diverse skillsets. Sam will discuss his work at Google designing and prototyping immersive computing
    systems across VR and world scale AR, and how this fits into an historical context of art and design that goes back centuries. He will also discuss how
    Google thinks about immersive computing, their design process, design systems and the new skills required by designers who are working within this nascent
    territory.

    **Bio:**
    Sam Keene works as a Lead User Experience Engineer at Google. His work focuses on virtual and augmented reality platforms, and he has recently published
    a book that covers the design and development for Google's AR and VR platforms:
    ["The Google Daydream VR Cookbook"](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Daydream-VR-Cookbook-Building/dp/013484551X). As a kid in the late â€™80s, he started
    programming on a Commodore 64 and has worked professionally as a mobile software engineer and interaction designer for more than a decade. Sam has
    lectured in Interactive Media at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, and his work has won numerous industry accolades including Gold Cannes
    Lions, IxDA, D&AD, and One Show awards.
