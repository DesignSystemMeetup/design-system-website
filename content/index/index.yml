        The Design Alliance

        Clone Wars: Stories of light and dark revealed
      description: |
        In a galaxy far, far away it is a period of great fragmentation. The Design Alliance lies in disarray - turf wars are the enemy. A series of battles
        between departments, vendors, systems and the IT departments leave many stars with multiple systems. Many of these systems don’t talk to each
        other and are not made to improve usability or achieve better outcomes.

        Join the resistance, see the first spark of hope that will become ....The Digital Experience+.
        Come follow the adventures of rolling out a design system that spans 3 galaxies and 15 star systems.
