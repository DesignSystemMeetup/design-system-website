      title: What's in a name? How Design Systems lead to better terminology decisions
      description: |
        Have you ever wondered why you “favourite” one thing but “star” something else?
        What role do Design System teams play when naming a brand new feature or renaming a legacy concept?
        Sarah Karp, a Content Design Manager at Atlassian, shares what goes on behind the scenes of a product terminology decision.
        In this talk, you’ll learn how to validate a terminology choice, get buy-in from stakeholders, and streamline naming decisions into a process that can be
        shared across entire organisations.
    - time: "6:45"
      name: Sash Singh
      title: Rebuilding our Design System & what we learned along the way
      description: |
        Where do you begin when you don’t have a design system?
        Sash leads the design team at Expert360 and will share experiences across a timeline of events such as getting stakeholder buy-in, starting a system
        from scratch, naming, going mobile first and where it all ended up.
        He will also cover approaches taken for vertical rhythm, design density, and colour.
    - time: "7:15"

      title: The Naming of Things
      description: |
        Giving a name to something is a powerful action.
        It's part of human nature to attach meaning and expectation to people, objects and ideas just from the name they have been given.
        For design systems this impacts everything from coding standards to the efficiency of collaboration between teams.
        How do you define components in a way all stakeholders can understand?
        How do you set APIs that will last?
        It all starts with naming things.
