      title: Open doors

      title: Building Tools To Lower Friction.
      description: |
        A design system is only good if it's used consistently, and great tooling can get you there. Join as Jake Miller goes over how Atlassian made a small
        investment into tooling which lead to a huge jump in adoption and consistency of Atlassian's design system, and saved every designer time in the
        process.

      title: Using a Design System in Framer X
      description: |
        A Design Systems code base is great for developers to consume, but designers are limited to downloading a SketchApp stencil or to use a plugin like
        Googleâ€™s [Material Theming](https://material.io/design/material-theming/#material-theming). What if designers could design with the same code
        components? Well now you can! Join Lincoln as he demonstrates how [Google Materials](https://material.io/) can be used within
        [Framer X](http://www.framer.com/) via [React Material Web Components](https://rmwc.io/). A single source of truth is finally possible!
