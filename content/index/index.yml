    #   description: |
    #     Despite smart people, good tools, and modern tech, why is it still hard
    #     to make Good and Compelling products? Boris has some thoughts,
    #     and some very practical suggestions for how teams of humans can
    #     do great work without hand-offs and siloes.

    #     Boris Bozic is the co-founder and Head of Design at Thinkmill â€“ a design
    #     and engineering consultancy that specialises in the broad definition of
    #     Design Systems. Boris leads cross functional teams that aim to produce
    #     Good and Compelling Products, usually with a Design System at the
    #     centre.
