        The Design Alliance

        Clone Wars: Stories of light and dark revealed
      description: |
        In a galaxy far, far away it is a period of great fragmentation. The Design Alliance lies in disarray - turf wars are the enemy. A series of battles
        between departments, vendors, systems and the IT departments leave many stars with multiple systems. Many of these systems don’t talk to each
        other and are not made to improve usability or achieve better outcomes.

        Join the resistance, see the first spark of hope that will become ....The Digital Experience+.
        Come follow the adventures of rolling out a design system that spans 3 galaxies and 15 star systems.

        ---

        Having spent a large part of her 23 year career in advertising and design, approximately 9 years ago Premika found herself
        naturally drawn to Human Centred Design, neuroscience and at that time the relatively new field of UX. Initially self taught, she
        went on to complete a Master’s in Digital Media/UX and pivoted into the world of redesigning enterprise software in aviation
        infotech, retail and e-commerce.

        Today she’s UX Lead at GovTech and works with the Ministry of Manpower in Singapore, tackling real world problems and building government e-services
        that uses technology to better serve and anticipate citizens’ needs.
