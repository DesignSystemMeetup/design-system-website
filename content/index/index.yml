    #     GraphQL for designers
    #   description: |
    #     Why do developers love GraphQL and how can designers best work with them?

    #     GraphQL is still the new kid on the block, but every day a new project is using it as "The API".
    #     In a world with increasingly complex requirements and engineering effort, finding the best way to understand and work with GraphQL can be beneficial
    #     for both designers and engineers.
    #     In this talk we'll cover:
    #     - What is GraphQL exactly
    #     - The benefits of GraphQL in a world of complex related data
    #     - Introducing the Gap Analysis System to level up the design <-> engineering collaboration
