      title: Design Systems The Missing Manual
      description: |
        This talk focuses on the missing considerations of Continuous Improvement and Innovation within a Design System.

        We work hard to optimise our processes in order to build better user centred products. Instead let's try looking at the people helping to build our
        Design Systems first by "measuring people to measure the process".
    - time: "7:00"

      title: 5 things our users want from the Atlassian Design System
      description: |
        Getting buy-in and building a design system is one thing, but validating that it is successful, understanding if it’s meeting the users’ needs and is
        actually helping them build better products is a whole new kettle of fish. After running Atlassian’s Design System team for 3 years, Alex
        Skougarevskaya, will share with you insights, tips and challenges that the team has faced and what they plan to do to overcome them. You will
        walk way with ideas and tips on how you ensure the design system you have built (or thinking about building) will not only be used but loved by
        it’s consumers.
