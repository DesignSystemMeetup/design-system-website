      name: Rozario Chivers
      description: |
        Rozario has dedicated 20+ years of his career to following inspirational evangelists of Web Standards (Patrick Griffiths), Microformats (Tantek Çelik),
        CSS Systems (Natalie Downe), Pattern Portfolios (Anna Debenham) and now Design Systems (Brad Frost).

        After delivering many high traffic, multi-tenanted Web sites and encountering the problems of Design at Scale he developed a number of unique strategies
        to overcome common problems.

        Rozario now Design's Design Systems with empirical evidence, enthusiastic engineering and a little humour via edutainment in the form of Code Comics.

  #     description: |
  #       That’s right. We are building automated docs for our design system, but that’s not the best part. It will work with any React project. In this talk I’m
  #       gonna share with you what I’ve learned in the process and show you how we built it (for the techies)
