# This is how we will construct this page; out of the below listed variables and partials.
# Cuttlebelle recognizes partials if they end with ".md" and that their path exists inside your content folder

title: Events

header:                # Our header part of the layout
  - /_shared/header.md # This is the header and we got it from another folder we use to share partials

events:
  - /_events/2018-04-15-atlassian.md
  - /_events/2018-02-28-dta.md


# You can pass in many more options to your layout here,
# things like a theme variable or a localization string.

# All variables declared in the index.yml are accessible
# inside each partial via props._pages[ props.ID ]
