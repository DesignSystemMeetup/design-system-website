        A design system that nobody can understand how to use is a design system nobody can use. This is why good documentation is so key to having a well-used and well-loved design system. Through this talk, I am going to be looking how we solved several of these problems in Atlaskit:

        * Cross-component tooling help make your docs consistent
        * Keeping documentation up-to-date (docs in code, prop type reading)
        * Keeping documentation in code (react-markings, now mdx)
        * Demonstrating proper usages (our learnings about examples)
        * Giving designers access to the design system (sketch plugin)
        * An integrated single site (where we have failed)
    - time: "7:00"

        That’s right. We are building automated docs for our design system, but that’s not the best part. It will work with any React project. In this talk I’m
        gonna share with you what I’ve learned in the process and show you how we built it (for the techies)
