      title: Different types of UI state
      description: |
        This will come as a surprise to many of you, but user interfaces on the web, have different types of state. It might be that "State", much like "Design
        Systems", is a word that has lost all meaning for you, but regardless, I think you will agree the UI state designers talk about is different
        from the application state developers refer to. Let's figure out how to have a discussion about these similar sounding but very different
        concepts for the sake of our sanity and better design system components.
